I work as an Economist at the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) and as an Adjunct Professor of Economics at the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC). My main research interests are Labor Economics, Development Economics, and Applied Econometrics.

I graduated from the Paris School of Economics (PSE) and the Sorbonne School of Economics (SSE) with an MRes in Economics (M2 Recherche APE, 2025) and an MSc in Quantitative Economics (M1 APE, 2024). I also hold an MSc in Applied Mathematics (2023) and a BSc in Economics (2019) from the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo (INTEC).

Previously, I worked as a Research Coordinator at the Grupo Privado por la Competitividad Nacional (GPCN) and as a Research and Development Specialist at Acción Empresarial por la Educación (EDUCA).
